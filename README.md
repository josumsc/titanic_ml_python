# Titanic: Survival deeply understood with Data

The RMS Titanic incident occured in 1912 and was labelled soon as one of the most notorious tragedies in western history, due to the fame gained during the construction of the ship as the biggest passenger ever built. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, and the factors that discriminate the survivors from the casualties are one of the most interesting aspects of the tragedy.

We will get a closer look on the mentioned factors that altered the chance of a certain person to survive, and try to fit a Machine Learning model to better understand them, and take our chances to guess if a third class male passenger aged 25 would have survived the tragedy, for instance.


## Notebook location
A slightly different version of this code is located at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/josumsc/visual-and-statictical-analysis-oop-pipeline) where you can follow up all the explanations needed to understand the exercise. Nevertheless, if you arrived here I highly recommend to download the code and play along using the environment provided.


## Installation of the environment

You can follow up this notebook in your machine by downloading [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and then running the following command in the terminal:
```shell
conda env create --file titanic.yml
```

This should have you prepared to run `jupyter notebook` in the terminal and then running the mentioned code using that familiar interface.
